                   I’m <span class="text-white font-bold">Lincoln T Chanakira</span>, a passionate Full Stack Developer and Data Scientist with a unique story that spans continents and industries. Born and raised in Mhondoro, Zimbabwe, I cultivated a curiosity for technology and problem-solving from a young age, serving as Head Boy at both Nyatsambo Primary and Ndarama High School.

                   Driven by a desire to bridge business and technology, I pursued a Bachelor’s in Business Studies and Computer Science at the University of Zimbabwe. I am currently working toward a <span class="text-white">Master’s in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at the Kogod School of Business</span>, American University.

                   My professional journey includes roles as an <span class="text-white">IT Audit Intern at NetOne Cellular</span>, focusing on IT governance and security, and as a Travel Consultant/Marketing Analyst. These experiences have allowed me to merge analytical skills with customer service and marketing strategy.

                   Now residing in Silver Spring, Maryland, I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and global perspective to solve complex problems. When I'm not coding, I'm a dedicated Manchester City fan and enjoy giving back through charity work with organizations like Amore Learning.

                   Fun fact: I once ran a successful sausage-making business in Zimbabwe—until I got scammed! Entrepreneurship is full of twists.
